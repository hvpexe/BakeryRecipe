Instruction :
Step 1:Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Grease a bundt pan (I used Coconut Oil and sprinkled flour on top) and set aside.
Step 2:Place the Guinness into a large saucepan and add the butter. Set the heat to low and melt the butter stirring occasionally.
Step 3 :Whisk the cocoa powder and sugar into the butter mixture and remove from the heat.
Step 4:In a medium bowl beat the sour cream, eggs, and vanilla together. Pour into the saucepan and mix until combined.
Step 5:Using a separate small bowl whisk the flour and baking soda together and add to the chocolate mixture. Stir until everything is evenly mixed.
Step sáu :Pour the cake batter into the greased pan and bake for 45 to 55 minutes or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean. Allow the cake to cool in the pan before attempting to remove it.
Step 7 :Place the dark chocolate and heavy cream in a medium saucepan and heat over medium heat, stirring continuously. Once fully combined remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla extract, salt, and Irish Cream if using.
Step 8:To thicken the ganache slightly place it in the fridge for 5 to 10 minutes before pouring it over the cake.
